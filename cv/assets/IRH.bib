  abstract = {Incubation involves behavioral decisions that highlight trade-offs between current and future reproductive success. Grouse (Phasianidae: Tetraoninae) life history favors incubation behaviors that prioritize the success of the current breeding attempt over adult survival. Observations of incubation behavior suggest substantial commitments on the part of incubating females, who face decisions regarding allocations of time, energy, and risk. These decisions are influenced by ambient conditions, body condition, and predation risk. We monitored nest attendance behavior by females at 30 Greater Prairie Chicken (\emph{Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus}; Brewster, 1885) nests in the Nebraska Sandhills, USA, to identify proximate cues used to make behavioral decisions regarding incubation. We recorded 930 total incubation off-bouts. Females took 1.9 {\textpm} 0.7 (SD) off-bouts/day of 43.3 {\textpm} 24.1 min. Off-bouts were shorter in duration at higher wind speeds, at lower ambient temperatures, at nests with less cover, and at those closer to roads. Females were most likely to leave the nest during the mid-morning and evening time periods, and off-bouts became less frequent later in the season. We did not observe any differences in incubation behavior between nests that failed and those that successfully hatched one or more chicks.},

  abstract = {Nest success is a vital component of fitness for individuals, and a major driver of population dynamics for many species. Ecological factors can play an important proximate role shaping annual patterns of nest success among bird populations. Globally, cooperatively-breeding bird species are distributed in harsh environments in which conditions undergo drastic and unpredictable changes from year to year. This unpredictability is thought to favor delayed dispersal by young, sexually mature individuals, who remain in their natal territory and aid in provisioning nestlings. Thus, the presence of helpers at the nest may act as a buffer, mediating the negative impacts of environmental fluctuations on the reproductive success of a dominant breeding pair. We monitored breeding behavior in Purple-backed Fairywrens (\emph{Malurus assimilis}) over six seasons between 2012 and 2018, capturing a high degree of variation in both social environment and physical environment. Previous studies of breeding behavior in this population have used fledging success as a proxy for reproductive success. Here, we estimate daily nest survival as a finer-scale metric by which to evaluate the relative importance of (and potential interacting effects of) social and climatological factors as predictors of reproductive output.},

  abstract = {Haemosporidian parasites of birds are geographically widespread, have been detected in a phylogenetically diverse array of hosts, and have been the focus of extensive research due to both their impacts on birds and their similarity to vector-borne diseases of humans. Advances in molecular diagnostic tools have created a greater awareness of the genetic diversity of haemosporidian infections. Yet in spite of their more or less global distribution, comparatively little is known about the haemosporidians affecting birds in Australia. We screened blood from 889 birds (23 species) for haemosporidian blood parasite infections during the 2019 breeding season at Brookfield Conservation Park, South Australia. We examined the genetic (lineage) diversity of haemosporidian infections in this behaviourally and ecologically diverse host assemblage and examined the congruence between parasite and host phylogenies. We identified seven Haemoproteus mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages, five of which were novel. Four birds had simultaneous co-infections by two Haemoproteus lineages each. The Haemoproteus lineages clustered at the host family level. Two Plasmodium lineages were also identified, each of which had been previously detected in different avian host species in Australasia. We did not detect any Leucocytozoon infections in our sample. This study supplies critical baseline data on host--parasite associations in a poorly-surveyed geographic region.},

  abstract = {Cooperatively breeding species exhibit a range of social behaviours associated with different costs and benefits to group living, often in association with different environmental conditions. For example, recent phylogenetic studies have collectively shown that the evolution and distribution of cooperative breeding behaviour is related to the environment. However, little is known about how environmental variation may drive differences in social systems across populations within species, and how the relationship between environmental conditions and sociality may differ across species. Here, we examine variation in social group size along a steep environmental gradient for two congeneric cooperatively breeding species of fairywrens (Maluridae) and show that they exhibit opposing ecogeographic patterns. Purple-backed fairywrens, a species in which helpers increase group productivity, have larger groups in hot, dry environments and smaller groups in cool, wet environments. By contrast, superb fairywrens, a species with helpers that do not increase group productivity despite the presence of alloparental care, exhibit the opposite trend. We suggest differences in the costs and benefits of sociality contribute to these opposing ecogeographical patterns and demonstrate that comparisons of intraspecific patterns of social variation across species can provide insight into how ecology shapes social systems.},

  abstract = {Conspicuous female signals have recently received substantial scientific attention, but it remains unclear if their evolution is the result of selection acting on females independently of males or if mutual selection facilitates female change. Species that express female, but not male, phenotypic variation among populations represents a useful opportunity to address this knowledge gap. White-shouldered fairywrens (Malurus alboscapulatus) are tropical songbirds with a well-resolved phylogeny where female, but not male, coloration varies allopatrically across subspecies. We explored how four distinct signaling modalities, each putatively associated with increased social selection, are expressed in two populations that vary in competitive pressure on females. Females in a derived subspecies (M. a. moretoni) have evolved more ornamented plumage and have shorter tails (a signal of social dominance) relative to an ancestral subspecies (M. a. lorentzi) with drab females. In response to simulated territorial intrusions broadcasting female song, both sexes of M. a. moretoni are more aggressive and more coordinated with their mates in both movement and vocalizations. Finally, M. a. moretoni songs are more complex than M. a. lorentzi, but song complexity does not vary between sexes in either population. These results suggest that correlated phenotypic shifts in coloration and tail morphology in females as well as song complexity and aggression in both sexes may have occurred in response to changes in the intensity of social selection pressures. This highlights increased competitive pressures in both sexes can facilitate the evolution of complex multimodal signals.},
