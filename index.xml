      <description>I’m a disease ecologist interested in the forces that influence how pathogens and parasites are transmitted through wildlife communities. Through studying patterns of infection by avian blood parasites in natural bird communities, I try to understand the roles played by animals’ social and physical environments on their risk of infection. I am currently a master’s student in the Nebraska One Health research group led by Liz VanWormer at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</description>
